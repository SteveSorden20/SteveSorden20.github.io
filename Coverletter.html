            Hello, My name is Steve Sorden and I am currently a student in the 
            Grand Canyon University Java Bootcamp program. I have been interested
            in being a program developer for a long time. In high school,
            I got some friends together to try and create IOS applications; however,
            without the proper resources to learn how to code, the task seemed daunting 
            and ultimately fell in priority at the time. In college, I was reintroduced to 
            programming when I took an intro to programming and then a C+ course as electives.
            I fell in love with development again but at the time I was almost done with my 
            engineering degree and didn't feel it was right to switch programs. After graduation,
            I felt pretty unsure about the career path that I was on and started to follow youtube 
            coding videos online. At this point, I was determined to become a developer and follow 
            through with actually learning and becoming a good programmer. I found the program 
            through GCU highly recommended and I have thoroughly enjoyed the time I've spent 
            learning to program. I know I have a passion for development and using my creativity 
            to design innovative applications and for the first time in my life I have found
            myself constantly pursuing learning opportunity outside of  class environment 
            because I find programming engaging and just plain fun!
        </p>
