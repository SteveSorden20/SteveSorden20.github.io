            Hello, My name is Steve Sorden and I am currently a student in the 
            Grand Caynon University Java Bootcamp program. I have been interested
            in being a program developer for as long back as high school when
            I got some friends together to try and create IOS applications; however,
            without the proper resources to learn how to code the task seemed daunting 
            ultimately feel in priority at the time. In college I was reintroduced to 
            programming when I took a intro to programming and then a C+ course as electives
            but at the time was almost done with my degree and didn't feel it was right to switch
            programs. After graduation I felt pretty unsure about the career path that I was on
            and started to follow youtube coding videos online. At this point I was determined to
            become a developer and follow through with learning. I found the program through GCU
            highly recommended and I have thoroughly enjoyed the time I've spent learning programming.
            I know I have a passion for developement and use my creativity to design innovative
            applications and for the first time in my life I have found myself constantly 
            pursueing learning opportunity outside of the class assignments because I find 
            programming engaging and just plain fun!
